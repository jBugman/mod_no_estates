### 'No Estates' mod for Europa Universalis IV

I do not like estates feature so I put together a simple mod to disable it.

* Disables estates for all countries
* Disables estate-related events
* Adds decision to remove existing estates from all provinces

Works best in new games but should retroactively apply to saves as well.
